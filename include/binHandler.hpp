*
* psx-comBINe is a simple program to combine multiple .bin files into a single
* file, and modified the .cue file indexing, this is ideal for PSX/PS1 CD-ROMs
* e.g. Rayman to get them ready for cue2pops or some emulators. I also find it 
* improves reliabilty when buring to a disk to only have one .bin file.
